# Supply Line Fault Detector
This is a project that I did for my third year in Engineering.In this project, a new power supply line fault detecting system is proposed. Using this we can monitor a single phase system, with the help of voltage and current sensors. The sensors will be installed on the transformers. Those will help in continuously monitoring the voltage and current of the supply line.Variations in the values of current voltage and frequency, from those values that are preset, will be notified as a fault.
We use Arduino Uno as the heart of the project .It will process the data from
the sensors and then send the information about the current status of the
supply grid line to the supply office through a GSM module. Depending on
the values obtained the cause for the fault can also be concluded and the
same will be informed to the office.We can even break the connection if
required.
A monitoring system will be provided for the updating and visualization of
the status. This helps the technician and administrators to monitor and know
about the supply line status from their office itself. So the technicians can
take immediate actions when an emergency situation arises.
