# Supply Line Fault Detector
This is a project developed for third-year engineering students to monitor a single phase power supply system. The system uses voltage and current sensors installed on the transformers to continuously monitor the supply line. The sensors detect variations in the values of voltage, current, and frequency, and any deviation from the preset values is notified as a fault.
Key Components

    Arduino Uno
    Voltage and Current Sensors
    GSM Module
    Monitoring System

How it Works

The Arduino Uno processes the data from the sensors and sends information about the current status of the supply grid line to the supply office via the GSM module. Depending on the values obtained, the cause of the fault can also be concluded and informed to the office. In case of an emergency, the connection can be broken, and a monitoring system will provide updates and visualizations of the status.
Benefits

This project helps technicians and administrators to monitor and keep track of the supply line status from their office, allowing them to take immediate actions in case of an emergency. The continuous monitoring of the supply line ensures that any faults are detected and addressed in a timely manner, improving the reliability and stability of the power supply system.
